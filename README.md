## üìò Overview
**SR-01** is an **Intelligent Ground Vehicle (IGV)** designed for autonomous navigation across varied terrains.  
It integrates **ROS2-based perception, planning, and control** to achieve self-driving capability, obstacle avoidance, and adaptive motion.  
The robot uses a **4-wheel independent swerve drive**, advanced **sensor fusion**, and **vision-based navigation** to operate without human control.

## üöÄ Key Features
- Fully autonomous navigation using **ROS2 Humble**
- **EKF-based sensor fusion** of LiDAR, IMU, and encoders
- **4-wheel swerve drive system** for omnidirectional movement
- **Depth and RGB perception** using Intel RealSense D435i
- **Gazebo + RViz simulation** for virtual testing
- **Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)** local planner for obstacle avoidance
- **QR/AR-based waypoint missions** for flexible route selection
- **Hardware-level safety** via E-stop and watchdog timers
